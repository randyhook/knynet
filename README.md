# knynet (KennyNet)
An artificial intelligence network for assisted living.

This is a research project at the moment, with aspirations of becoming something much greater, that is attempting to map out the schema of and develop algorithms for a network of artificial intelligent agents to assist those with disabilities. This project's goal is to solve such challenges as:
* How can a person with multiple impairments live independently with the help of intelligent agents?
* How can multiple intelligent agents work together to perform daily duties for someone with special needs?
* How can intelligent agents be used to greatest effect when combined with robotics?

This project is drawing its greatest influences at present from:
* Isaac Asimov's robots
* Marvin Minsky's Society of Mind

## Installation and Starting
This project is currently being developed with Python 3.4.3. Unzip the contents of this repository in a folder, and assuming Python is in your path, type start.py. There are currently no other dependencies.

The program doesn't do anything outwardly interesting in its current state. A TkInter window will be displayed and a couple of simulated bots will power up and display a few messages. Type quit to power down the bots. Much of the schema is starting to take shape in the code, and I will be providing a diagram shortly so you can see the big picture.
