A network of intelligent agents for assisted living.

This is a research project at the moment, with aspirations of becoming something much greater, that is attempting to map out the schema of and develop algorithms for a network of artificial intelligent agents to assist those with disabilities. This project's goal is to solve such challenges as:
* How can a person with multiple impairments live independently with the help of intelligent agents?
* How can multiple intelligent agents work together to perform daily duties for someone with special needs?
* How can intelligent agents be used to greatest effect when combined with robotics?

This project is drawing its greatest influences at present from:
* Isaac Asimov's robots
* Marvin Minsky's Society of Mind

## Installation and Starting
This project is currently being developed with Python 3.4.3. Clone this repository, and assuming Python is in your path, type start.py. The Natural Language Toolkit is implemented as a submodule, so you will need to run git submodule init and git submodule update.

The program doesn't do anything outwardly interesting in its current state. A TkInter window will be displayed and a couple of simulated bots will power up and display a few messages. Type quit to power down the bots. Much of the schema is starting to take shape in the code, and I will be continuing to document the architecture as the project progresses.
