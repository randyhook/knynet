# knynet (KennyNet)
A network of intelligent agents for assisted living.

This is a research project at the moment, with aspirations of becoming something much greater, that is attempting to map out the schema of and develop algorithms for a network of artificial intelligent agents to assist those with disabilities. This project's goal is to solve such challenges as:
* How can a person with multiple impairments live independently with the help of intelligent agents?
* How can multiple intelligent agents work together to perform daily duties for someone with special needs?
* How can intelligent agents be used to greatest effect when combined with robotics?

This project is drawing its greatest influences at present from:
* Isaac Asimov's robots
* Marvin Minsky's Society of Mind
* Countless researchers in the AI field that I look up to

## Installation and Starting
This project is currently being developed with Python. Clone this repository, and assuming Python is in your path, type start.py. The Natural Language Toolkit is implemented as a submodule, so you will need to it, preferably using pip (e.g. python -m pip install nltk)

## Documentation
Check out the [wiki](https://github.com/randyhook/knynet/wiki) for extended documentation.

## Credits
Natural Language algorithms use the [Natural Language Toolkit](http://www.nltk.org).

## Changes

2017-07-03 I've started a major retool, so if you've seen this repo before, it is now drastically different. You may view the history if you are curious about any previous code.
